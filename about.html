      <h3>Our mission</h3>
      <p>
        We aim to empower refugees by teaching them the necessary skills for a
        career in software development. We believe coding can help people in
        disadvantaged situations live up to their potential, get back control
        of their own lives and be an important change to their environment.
      </p>

    <div class="our-vision">
      <h3>Our vision</h3>
      <p>
        We believe in an IT world where everyone has access to open knowledge
        and open education, in order to participate actively in society. We
        believe diversity is essential on IT company floors, which can be
        increased by hiring our graduates as junior web developers.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        HackYourFuture was initially founded in 2015 in Amsterdam. Because our
        curriculum is 100% open, the school was replicated in many countries,
        including Belgium in 2018. All International Chapters share the aim to
        enable refugees and disadvantaged people to build digital skills for a
        career in web development, facilitate the integration of newcomers,
        and address the shortage of qualified workforce in the IT sector.
